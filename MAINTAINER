Maintainer Information
======================

A brief remark for maintainers. To build the doc files (including the
man page) from sgml sources you need the docbook-xsl style sheets,
xsltproc, and lynx. Invoke the configure script like this

      $ ./configure --enable-build-doc --with-xsl-path=<path>

where <path> is the path where the docbook style sheets are installed.
