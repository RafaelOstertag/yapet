Maintainer Information
======================

To build the doc files (README*, INSTALL*, and man pages) from sgml
sources you need docbook 4.5, docbook style sheets, xsltproc, and w3m.

After running configure, cd into doc/ and do

 make -f Makefile.doc

The location of the docbook style sheets can be provided, if
necessary, by using

 make -f Makefile.doc DOCBOOK_BASE=/usr/share/sgml/docbook/xsl-stylesheets
