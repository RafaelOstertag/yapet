BUGS
====

* The user interface is clumsy and not really user friendly. It may
  flicker while running YAPET in a secure shell session session.

* Clearing the memory when it is no longer used seems to be buggy
  since the master password might be written to a core file.

Please report bugs to Rafael Ostertag <rafi@guengel.ch>.
