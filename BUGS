BUGS
====

YAPET
-----

* The user interface is clumsy and not really user friendly. It may flicker
  while running YAPET in a secure shell session.

* Clearing the memory when it is no longer used seems buggy since the master
  password is written to a core file sometimes.


csv2yapet
---------

* If the field separating character is part of the field value, it is
  misinterpreted as field delimiter.
