== NAME

== SYNOPSIS

yapet2csv [[-c] [-h] [-V]] | [[-H] | [-p _password_] | [-q] [-s
_separator_]] _src_ _dst_

== DESCRIPTION

Convert a YAPET file to a CSV file. The source file specified by _src_
will not be modified.

The resulting CSV file _dst_ has the following format:

|===
|Column #|YAPET record field
|1|Record Name
|2|Host Name
|3|User Name
|4|Password
|5|Comment
|===

== OPTIONS

*-h*:: Show help.
*-c*:: Show copyright.
*-V*:: Show version.
*-H*:: Add header line to CSV file.
*-p*:: Use the master password _password_ provided to decrypt
	  _src_. The use of this option is not recommended for
	  security reasons. By default, {yapet2csv} prompts for the
	  master password.
*-q*:: Do not produce verbose output, except for error messages. By
	  default, {yapet2csv} will print a period for each converted
	  password record to stdout.
_src_:: Source YAPET fiel name which will be converted to CSV and
	  stored in _dst_. If the file path does not end in _.pet_, {yapet2csv} will append
	  _.pet_ to the operand.
_dst_:: Pathname where the converted YAPET file will be
	  stored. The file must not exist prior to invoking
	  {yapet2csv}.

== EXIT STATUS
