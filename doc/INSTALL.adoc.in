== Build Prerequisites

YAPET was designed to have only few library dependencies, and to build
on most popular Unixes.

To build YAPET, you need the following libraries

* https://www.openssl.org">https://www.openssl.org[OpenSSL]
* Curses or https://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/[Ncurses]
* https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2[Argon2]
* https://freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/cppunit/[CppUnit]

CppUnit is only used during build to perform unit tests. It is not required to run YAPET.

As of version 0.3, YAPET uses GNU Gettext for
internationalization. Hence GNU Gettext is an optional dependency.

== Supported Compilers

YAPET is written in C\+\+, so you obviously need a C++ compiler to
compile. It compiles out of the box using the following compilers:

* Clang
* GNU GCC


== Brief Build Instructions

YAPET uses a `configure` script as generated by `autoconf` and friends
for configuring the build process of YAPET. Change to the directory
where you unpacked `@YPPKG@` and simply type

    # ./configure

on the command line. The `configure` script will then check the system
and prepare for the build process.

If the `configure` script successfully finishes, type

    # make

YAPET will now be built. After the build has finished you can

   # sudo make install

This will install YAPET into the `/usr/local/bin` directory, if the prefix has
not been changed.
