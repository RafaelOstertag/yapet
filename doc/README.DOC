DOC
===

Documentation is built outside the normal ./configure && gmake
sequence. Built files are included in the distribution, though.

In order to build the documentation, call

 gmake -f Makefile.doc

after configure has been run.

Before making the distribution, call

 gmake -f Makefile.doc put-distfiles

in order to install the files required by the distribution.
