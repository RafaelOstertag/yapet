    <title>Introduction</title>

    <para>&YP; is a curses based password encryption tool using the Blowfish
    encryption algorithm to store password records encrypted on disk. Its
    primary aim is to provide a safe way to store passwords in a file on disk
    while having a small footprint, and compiling and running under today's
    most popular Unixes, such as &SOLARIS;, &FREEBSD;, and Linux.</para>

    <para>If you are looking for a fully fledged password encryption
    tool having a graphical user interface, I recommend you start with
    revelation (<ulink url="http://oss.codepoet.no/revelation/">http://oss.codepoet.no/revelation</ulink>). &YP;
    is text based and less feature rich in comparison to
    revelation.</para>

    <title>Motivation</title>

    <para>
    Using several different Unixes, I wanted to have a single
    application running on all Unixes for storing my passwords in a
    secure manner. While revelation is running fine under &FREEBSD;
    and Linux, it's a pain to get it run under &SOLARIS; 10 (as you can
    see, the only tool I tried was revelation). It has many
    dependencies because it uses GNOME and PyGNOME. I didn't want to
    go thru the hassle of installing PyGNOME under &SOLARIS;, and
    decided to roll my own.</para>

    <title>Installation</title>

    <para>&YP; uses a <command>configure</command> script for
      configuring the build process. Refer to the
      <filename>INSTALL</filename> file in the source tarball
      <filename>&YPPKG;</filename>.</para>

  <sect1 id="usage">
    <title>Usage</title>

    <para>&YP; is kept simple. You should not find it difficult to
    use. The user interface has some quirks, though.</para>

    <para>See the manual page <citerefentry><refentrytitle>yapet</refentrytitle>
