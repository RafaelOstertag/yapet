== NAME

csv2yapet - convert CSV file to YAPET file

== SYNOPSIS

{csv2yapet} [[-c] | [-h] | [-V]] | [[-p _password_] [-q] [-s
_separator_]] _src_ _dst_

== DESCRIPTION

Convert a CSV file _src_ to an YAPET file
_dst_. The default character for delimiting
the fields is '_,_' (comma) unless specified otherwise on the command
line by providing the *-s*.

Fields containing the field separator character have to be
enclosed in double quotes (_"_).

In order to convert a double quote character it has to be preceded by
another double quote character.

The following table describes the fields of the source CSV file
as expected by {csv2yapet}:

.Source File Format
|===
|Column #|YAPET Record Field|Maximum size in bytes
|1|Record Name|127
|2|Host Name|255
|3|User Name|255
|4|Password|255
|5|Comment|511
|===

== OPTIONS

The following options are supported:


*-c*:: Show copyright.
*-h*:: Show help.
*-V*:: Show version.
*-p* _password_:: The password to be used to encrypt the YAPET file. If
	    {csv2yapet}is invoked without this option, it will prompt
	    for the password on the standard input.
*-q*:: Enable the quiet mode. No details about errors are reported.
*-s* _separator_:: Change the default field separator '_,_' (comma) to the
	    single character _separator_.
_src_:: The source CSV file to be converted.
_dst_:: The resulting YAPET file holding the content of  _src_
	    encrypted. This file must not exist prior to the
	    conversion process, else {csv2yapet} will not start the
	    conversion and abort.

== EXAMPLES

== An example of a CSV file accepted by {csv2yapet}.

The following example shows an excerpt of a CSV file as accepted for
conversion by {csv2yapet}.

As the second line shows, fields can be blank but the separator may
not be omitted.

```

mail account,imap.email.org,john_doe,secret,
```

The following example shows an excerpt of a CSV file as accepted for
conversion by {csv2yapet}.

The first line demonstrates how to double quote fields containing the
separator character. The second line shows how to literally convert
double quote characters.

mail account,imap.email.org,john_doe,secret,"John ""the Unknown"" Doe"
```

== EXIT STATUS

*1*:: Error while parsing command line argument.
*2*:: The passwords provided on the standard input do not match.
*3*:: The destination file _dst_ already exists.
*4*:: An unexpected error occurred.
