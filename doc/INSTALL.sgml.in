Installation Instructions
=========================


Quick & Dirty
-------------

&YP; uses a configure script as generated by autoconf and friends for
configuring the build process of &YP;. Change to the directory where you
unpacked &YPPKG; and simply type

	# ./configure

on the command line. The configure script will then check the system an
prepares for the build process.

If the configure script successfully finishes, type

	# make 

&YP; will now be builded. After the build has finished, switch to the root user
if not done already, and type

	# make install

This will install &YP; into the /usr/local/bin directory, if the prefix has not
been changed by providing '--prefix=<PATH>' to the configure script.


Brief configure Options Description
-----------------------------------

--prefix=<PATH>			<PATH> is the base directory where &YP; will be
				installed. The executable is installed in
				<PATH>/bin

--with-curses-include=<PATH>	This option tells the compiler where to find
				the header files of curses/ncurses. <PATH> has
				to be the directory where the header files are
				located, not the file name of the header file.

--with-curses-lib=<PATH>	This option tells the linker where to find the
				curses/ncurses shared library. <PATH> has to be
				the directory where the shared library is
				located, not the file name of the shared library.

--with-openssl-include=<PATH>	This options tells the compiler where to find

--with-openssl-lib=<PATH>
