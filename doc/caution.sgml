<para>Although I took several precautions to avoid having any
  passwords stored clear text in memory, I was able to snoop up the
  master password in a core file. This means for you, the user of
  &YP;, that it is possible, though not likely, for a malicious user
  to get hold of one or more passwords <emphasis>while</emphasis> &YP;
  is running. <emphasis>But</emphasis> remember, the passwords stored
  in the files created by &YP; are encrypted and not stored clear
  text. This is the best possible way of keeping them stored on a
  disk. The best overall method for keeping them, is to memorize them
  and not writing them down in any form.</para>
