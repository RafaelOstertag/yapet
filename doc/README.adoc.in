= YAPET - Yet Another Password Encryption Tool @PACKAGE_VERSION@
Rafael Ostertag <rafi@guengel.ch>

== Introduction

YAPET is a text based password manager using the AES-256 encryption
algorithm to store passwords and associated information encrypted on
disk. Its primary aim is to provide a safe way to store passwords in a
file on disk while having a small footprint, and compiling and running
under today's most popular Unix Systems.

The password records are protected by a master password which is used
to encrypt and decrypt the password records.

== Supported Platforms
    
YAPET has been tested on following platforms:

* FreeBSD
* OpenBSD
* NetBSD
* Linux

== Features

YAPET features:

* AES-256 encryption.
* Passwords are not kept clear text in memory.
* Locks the terminal on inactivity.
* Utilities to convert to and from CSV format.
* Built-in password generator.

Depends only on three libraries:

* http://www.openssl.org/[OpenSSL]
* Curses or http://www.gnu.org/software/ncurses/[Ncurses]
* https://github.com/P-H-C/phc-winner-argon2[Argon2]


CAUTION: Although several precautions were taken to avoid having any
  passwords stored clear text in memory, there were occasions when
  core files contained the master password. This means that it is
  possible, though not likely, for a malicious user to get hold of one
  or more passwords *while* YAPET is running.
