== NAME

yapet_config - format of a YAPET configuration file

== DESCRIPTION

*yapet(1)* reads the configuration file *$HOME/.yapet* if it exists
unless a different file is specified by using the *-r* option (see
*yapet(1)*). Options given on the command line override options given
in a configuration file.

The configuration file has the following syntax:

 option=value

where _option_ can be any of the following:

`colors`:: (String) Set custom colors. See *yapet_colors(5)* for more information.
`load`:: (String) The file to load upon start of *yapet*. Equivalent
	 to providing a _filename_ when invoking *yapet*. A `~`
	 (tilde) sign as the first character of the pathname will be
	 replaced by the home directory of the user running *yapet*.
+
Default: not set
`locktimeout`:: (Integer) A positive integer specifying the time of
	    inactivity in seconds until the screen is
	    locked. Equivalent to providing the *-t* option when
	    invoking *yapet*.
+
Default: 600
`pwinputtimeout`:: (Integer) A positive integer specifying the time of
	    inactivity in seconds until the password prompt for
	    unlocking the screen will disappear.
+
Default: 60
`allowlockquit`:: (Boolean) A value of `true` allows the user to quit
	    *yapet* from the locked screen (if no changes are
	    pending). +
	    A value of `false` prevents the user from
	    quitting *yapet* when the screen is locked.
+
Default: `true`
`checkfsecurity`:: (Boolean) A value of `true` enables the
	    verification of the file owner and permissions when
	    loading a file. +
	    A value of `false` disables the verification of the file
	    owner and permissions when loading a file. Equivalent to
	    providing the *-S* (same as `true`) or *-s* (same as
	    `false`) options when invoking *yapet*.
+
Default: `true`
`pwgen_rng`:: (String) The random number generator used to generate
	      passwords. Possible values are
 	      * `devrandom` Request using _/dev/random_. This is a
		    high-quality random number generator. However, if
		    the system lacks entropy, reading from this device
		    may block, thus making *yapet* unresponsive.
	      * `devurandom`: Request using _/dev/urandom_. This is a
		    quality random number generator similar to
		    _/dev/random_ but not of the same quality. Using
		    this random number generator will not block as
		    opposite to _/dev/random_.
	      * `rand`: Request using *rand(3)*. This is a last resort
		    random number generator and should not be used.
+
Default: devurandom
`pwgen_pwlen`:: (Integer) A positive integer greater than zero
	    specifying the default password length used by the
	    Password Generator Dialog.
+
Default: 15
*pwgen_letters*:: (Boolean) A value of `true` will preselect the
	    *Letters* check box of the Password Generator Dialog.
+
Default: `true`
*pwgen_digits*:: (Boolean) A value of `true` will preselect the
	    *Digits* check box of the Password Generator Dialog.
+
Default: `true`
*pwgen_punct*:: (Boolean) A value of `true` will preselect the
	     *Punctuation* check box of the Password Generator Dialog.
+
Default: `true`
*pwgen_special*:: (Boolean) A value of `true` will preselect the
	     *Special* check box of the Password Generator Dialog.
+
Default: `true`
*pwgen_other*:: (Boolean) A value of `true` will preselect *Other*
	     check box of the Password Generator Dialog.
+
Default: `false`

For Boolean values, `1`, `yes`, `true`, `enable`, and `enabled` denote
true. `0`, `false`, `no`, `disable`, `disabled` denote false. Please
note, Boolean values are case-sensitive.

See <<examples>> for examples of configuration files.

== EXAMPLES

[#example1]
=== Example of an yapet configuration file
```
load=/home/joe/passwords
locktimeout=300
checkfsecurity=0
pwgen_pwlen=8
```

In this example, the file _/home/joe/passwords_ will be loaded upon
invocation of *yapet*. The timeout until the screen is locked is set
to 300 seconds. File permissions will not be verified.

The Password Generator Dialog will have preset the *Password Length*
to 8 characters.

=== Example of an *yapet* configuration file

 locktimeout=150
 checkfsecurity=yes
 pwgen_other=enable

In this example, no file will be automatically loaded upon invocation
of *yapet*. The timeout until the screen is locked is set to 150
seconds. File permissions and owner will be verified.

The Password Generator Dialog will have preset the *Other* check box
checked.


=== Example 1 revisited

 load=~/passwords.pet
 locktimeout=300
 checkfsecurity=false
 pwgen_pwlen=8

This example has the same effect as <<example1>>. But instead of
specifying the full path to the home directory, the ~ (tilde) sign is
used, which is expanded to the home directory automatically. The
_.pet_ suffix can be specified, but if omitted it will be appended
automatically.

== FILES

_$HOME/.yapetrc_:: The per-user configuration file. If existing,
	    options are read from this file but can be overridden by
	    the command line options. +
	    Processing of this file can be
	    disabled by invoking *yapet* with the *-i* option.
