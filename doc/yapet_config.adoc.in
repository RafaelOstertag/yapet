== NAME

yapet_config - format of a YAPET configuration file

== DESCRIPTION

{yp-mp} reads the configuration file {rcfile} if it exists
unless a different file is specified by using the *-r* option, see
{yp-mp}. Options given on the command line override options given in
a configuration file.

The configuration file has the following syntax:

 option=value

where _option_ can be any of the following:

*colors*:: (String) Set custom colors. See {yp-colors-mp} for more information.
*load*:: (String) The file to load upon start of {yapet}. Equivalent
	 to providing a _filename_ when invoking {yapet}. A _~_
	 (tilde) sign as the first character of the pathname will be
	 replaced by the home directory of the user running {yapet}.
+
Default: not set
*locktimeout*:: (Integer) A positive integer specifying the time of
	    inactivity in seconds until the screen is
	    locked. Equivalent to providing the *-t* option when
	    invoking {yapet}.
+
Default: 600
*pwinputtimeout*:: (Integer) A positive integer specifying the time of
	    inactivity in seconds until the password prompt for
	    unlocking the screen will disappear.
+
Default: 60
*allowlockquit*:: (Boolean) A value of _true_ allows the user to quit
	    {yapet} from the locked screen (if no changes are
	    pending). +
	    A value of _false_ prevents the user from
	    quitting {yapet} when the screen is locked.
+
Default: _true_
*checkfsecurity*:: (Boolean) A value of _true_ enables the
	    verification of the file owner and permissions when
	    loading a file. +
	    A value of _false_ disables the verification of the file
	    owner and permissions when loading a file. Equivalent to
	    providing the *-S* (same as _true_) or *-s* (same as
	    _false_) options when invoking {yapet}.
+
Default: _true_
*pwgen_pwlen*:: (Integer) A positive integer greater than zero
	    specifying the default password length used by the
	    Password Generator Dialog.
+
Default: 15
*pwgen_letters*:: (Boolean) A value of _true_ will preselect the
	    *Letters* check box of the Password Generator Dialog.
+
Default: _true_
*pwgen_digits*:: (Boolean) A value of _true_ will preselect the
	    *Digits* check box of the Password Generator Dialog.
+
Default: _true_
*pwgen_punct*:: (Boolean) A value of _true_ will preselect the
	     *Punctuation* check box of the Password Generator Dialog.
+
Default: _true_
*pwgen_special*:: (Boolean) A value of _true_ will preselect the
	     *Special* check box of the Password Generator Dialog.
+
Default: _true_
*pwgen_other*:: (Boolean) A value of _true_ will preselect *Other*
	     check box of the Password Generator Dialog.
+
Default: _false_
*argon2_memory*:: (Integer) Memory used by the Argon2 hash algorithm
 in KB.
+
Default: 262144
*argon2_parallelism*:: (Integer) Number of threads used by the Argon2
 hash algorithm.
+
Default: 16
*argon2_iterations*:: (Integer) Number of iterations performed by the Argon2 hash algorithm.
+
Default: 5

For Boolean values, _1_, _yes_, _true_, _enable_, and _enabled_ denote
true. _0_, _false_, _no_, _disable_, _disabled_ denote false. Please
note, Boolean values are case-sensitive.

The **argon2_*** options only take effect when creating a new file or
changing the master password of an existing file.

[#examples]
== EXAMPLES

[#example1]
=== Example of an yapet configuration file
```
load=/home/joe/passwords
locktimeout=300
checkfsecurity=0
pwgen_pwlen=8
```

In this example, the file _/home/joe/passwords_ will be loaded upon
invocation of {yapet}. The timeout until the screen is locked is set
to 300 seconds. File permissions will not be verified.

The Password Generator Dialog will have preset the *Password Length*
to 8 characters.

=== Example of an {yapet} configuration file
```
locktimeout=150
checkfsecurity=yes
pwgen_other=enable
```

In this example, no file will be automatically loaded upon invocation
of {yapet}. The timeout until the screen is locked is set to 150
seconds. File permissions and owner will be verified.

The Password Generator Dialog will have preset the *Other* check box
checked.


=== Example 1 revisited

```
load=~/passwords.pet
locktimeout=300
checkfsecurity=false
pwgen_pwlen=8
```

This example has the same effect as <<example1>>. But instead of
specifying the full path to the home directory, the _~_ (tilde) sign
is used, which is expanded to the home directory automatically. The
_.pet_ suffix can be specified, but if omitted it will be appended
automatically.

== FILES

*{rcfile}*:: The per-user configuration file. If existing,
	    options are read from this file but can be overridden by
	    the command line options. +
	    Processing of this file can be
	    disabled by invoking {yapet} with the *-i* option.
