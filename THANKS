THANKS
======

First and foremost to my wife Anic, for her patience during my hacking
sessions.

Further I would like to thank Salvatore Bonaccorso for maintaining the official
Debian packages (the ones found in the Debian distro, not the ones on my web
site).

Laurent Guerby also deserves a big thank-you for maintaining the GCC Compile
Farm, which I use to test YAPET on different processor architectures.

And of course all users of YAPET...
